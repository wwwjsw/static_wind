### Files
- **`index.html`**: This file is the entry point of the application. It contains the basic structure of the HTML document, including the `<head>` and `<body>` tags. The content of the page is defined within the `<body>` tag.
- **`main.css`**: This file contains the CSS classes that were extracted from Tailwind for new custom classes. The custom classes are defined in the `main.css` file and can be used throughout the project.
- **`output.css`**: This file contains the optimized CSS code generated by Tailwind. It only contains the classes that were used in the project, which makes the file smaller and more efficient.

### How to run
- run `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch` to update your `output.css`
